### MoonFoundation

The target mostly contains a set of usuful extensions of `Foundation`:

let array = [1, 2, 3]
let currentValue = 2
let nextValue = array.next(after: currentValue) // Optional(3)
let previousValue = array.previous(before: currentValue) // Optional (1)
``` 

### MoonPresentation

The target contains a set of extensions of `UIKit` as well as our laconic syntax wrapper for constrainting layout:

```swift
import MoonPresentation

    // ...
    
    private func layout() {
        [tableView, bottomView].forEach(addSubview)
        tableView.constrain(.all(except: .bottom), to: self)
        tableView.constrain(.bottom, to: bottomView, edge: .top)
        bottomView.constrain(.all(except: .top), to: self)
    }
